# libswe

This is a fork of the [Swiss Ephemeris][sweph].  There is no plan to carry on independent development in alternative directions: instead, this is about making the Swiss Ephemeris available for easier integration with selected platforms.

# To Do

- [ ] Add emscripten.mk, producing a JavaScript build that can be used in HTML5 applications.
- [ ] Add Android.mk for use with the Android NDK and conforming to [best practices][vleu-authors].

# License
